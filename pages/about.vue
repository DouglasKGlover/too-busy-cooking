          I'm sick of hearing peoples' life stories every time I want to cook
          anything slightly more complicated than pancakes. Pair that with
          endless ads and being tracked by every damn site on the internet, I
          got kind of sick of the whole thing.
        </p>
        <p>So I made this site to put up recipes with <em>none</em> of that.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>No ads</li>
          <li>No analytics</li>
          <li>No affiliate links</li>
          <li>No goddamn life story</li>
          <li>No cookies (except the good kind LOL BAKING JOKE)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This "About" page is the closest thing really to an "article" on the
          site and you never have to look at it unless you clicked on the link
          to get here out of some weird curiosity.
